🎭 DEEPFACE DETECTION IN PYTHON 🎭
Team Name : 👉 HeraPheri 👈
Project Description : In our project , the basic idea resolves around the face . As the face is important in every profile verification process just to be a legit consumer or customer , but there are some organisations which are continuously trying to fake this process using fake pictures . Thus , python provides a wide range of libraries to tackle this issue and we have following libraries 🗂️ ;

DeepFace

Open CV : cv2

Tensorflow

Keras

Numpy

Matplotlib.pyplot

Pandas , time , random , json & etc .

With above libraries it is easy to solve picture related issues. In end we have authenticity of pictures with the person uploading it .
We took help from SERENGIL's github and youtube channel 🎬 . https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsS_1RYmYQQFdWqxQggXHynP1rqaYXv_E
Overview : we firstly , imported some useful libraries and then we used difine fuction ( def (_): ) . Then we import our datasets which contains some pictures to test and train our model and finally we have our corrected predictions of various pictures . 🎭✔️ Modeling: [Image 118.jpg]
